# dbt-workspace

Welcome to dbt-workspace! This repository contains the dbt code related to the ongoing project.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get started with contributing to this project.

### 1. Create a New Branch

Before making any changes, it's a good practice to create a new branch. This keeps your changes isolated from the main codebase.

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Replace your-branch-name with a descriptive branch name for your feature or bug fix.

### 2. Make Your Changes
Now that you're on your new branch, make your desired changes to the codebase. Feel free to write code, update documentation, or make any other necessary modifications.

### 3. Stage and Commit Your Changes
Once you've made your changes, stage and commit them with a descriptive message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
```

### 4. Push Your Branch
To update the remote repository with your changes, push your branch to GitHub:

``` bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 5. Create a Pull Request
To merge your changes into the main codebase, you need to create a pull request (PR).

  1. Go to the "Pull Requests" tab on the GitHub repository.
  2. Click the "New Pull Request" button.
  3. Select your branch as the source and the main branch as the target.
  4. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes in the PR.
  5. Click "Create Pull Request."

Your changes will be reviewed, and they will be merged into the main codebase once approved.
